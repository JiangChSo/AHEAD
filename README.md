# The implementation of AHEAD 

AHEAD is a two-factor authenticated key exchange scheme that is suitable for biometrics with low entropy rates.

1. The public parameters (e.g., generators and orders of groups) are given in Params.py;
2. Oblivious transfer is implemented via oblivious_transfer.py;
3. The reconstruction algorithm of robust secret sharing in the exponent (RSSExp) is implemented via RSSExp_Rec.py;
4. The whole implementation of AHEAD is provided by PAKE.py;

Running PAKE.py to obtain the experimental results.
